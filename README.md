# Document-for-CDC-Data-Pipeline-Sales-Data-Analysis
Designed and implemented a Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline for sales data analysis. The pipeline ingests random order data generated by a mock script into DynamoDB via EventBridge. Kinesis streams capture CDC events from DynamoDB, and a Kinesis Firehose batch-processes and transforms the data using Lambda. The transformed data is then stored in S3, and Glue Crawler collects metadata. Finally, Athena is connected to query the data.
